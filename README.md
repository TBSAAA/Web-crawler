# Learning Web Crawler

This repository is a personal record of my journey learning web crawling. As I delve into the subject and gain more knowledge, I will update this repository with my notes, code snippets, and examples of my work.

## Goals

My goal is to learn how to extract valuable information from websites and to better understand the inner workings of the web. By the end of my journey, I aim to have a solid understanding of the following:

- How to send HTTP requests and handle responses
- How to parse HTML and extract useful information
- How to interact with websites that use APIs
- How to avoid getting banned by websites through techniques such as rate limiting and user-agent rotation
- How to store and analyze the data that I've collected

## Content

This repository will contain the following:

- Notes on web crawling concepts and techniques
- Code snippets in Python demonstrating how to extract information from websites
- Working examples of web crawlers that I've built
- Data that I've collected through my crawlers

## Why Web Crawling

Web crawling is an essential tool in data science, enabling us to gather vast amounts of information from websites and use it for a variety of purposes. Whether it's to gather information for research purposes, or to extract valuable data for business intelligence, web crawling provides a means to access the vast amounts of information available on the web in an automated and scalable manner.

By learning web crawling, I hope to gain a better understanding of the web and how to extract valuable information from it.

## Conclusion

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about web crawling. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I hope that others will find my notes and code snippets useful in their own learning journeys.
